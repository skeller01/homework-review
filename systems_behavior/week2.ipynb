    "Q3: You are trying to determine how many (weekly) magazines to produce in any production run. It costs you 1.00 to print each magazine and you sell magazines for 2.50 each. if you don't sell all your magazines, then the excess must be disposed at a cost of .05 per magazine. Demand per week is D. Assume weekly demandeds are i.i.d. Let x be the number of magazines you decide to produce each week, and let f(x) be the resulting expected profit per week. (a) Build a pandas dataframe that computes, for any given value of x, an estimate of f(x) along with a 95% confidence interval based on demand per week, D. (b) use your pandas dataframe to obtain the approximately optimal value, x*, that maximizes f(x) and report (i) your estimasted confidence interval for f(x*). (c) Say your confidence interval from Part (b) is [a1, a2] for certain values a1 and a2. Is it true that the random profit next week will lie in the interval [a1,a2] with probability .95? Explain"
